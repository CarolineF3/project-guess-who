# Project Name

Project 5, Guess Who.

This weeks assignment was to create a classic Guess Who board game. 

## The problem

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript when approaching this problem. I worked with forEach loops, arrays and objects. I added a confetti animation by downloading some files from https://www.cssscript.com/tag/confetti/. As always I used Beautify to tidy up my code. If I had more time I would have changed the images and created a different version of the game.
